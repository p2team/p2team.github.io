  headline: Jorge Vieira gave the first Seminar of the EuPRAXIA Virtual Seminar Series.
  fullstory: The [seminar](https://agenda.infn.it/event/45900/page/10216-achieving-superradiant-plasma-accelerator-based-light-sources-with-collective-effects) focused on the recent [quasiparticle light source concept](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-023-01311-z) (which may bring temporal coherence and superradiance to plasma accelerator-based light sources.), was the first seminar of the [EuPRAXIA Virtual Seminar Series](https://agenda.infn.it/event/45900/).
