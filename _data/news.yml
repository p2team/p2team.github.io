  headline: Jorge Vieira gave a Seminar at the Center of Physics and Engineering of Advanced Materials [(CeFEMA)](https://cefema.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/people/joao-seixas/).
  fullstory: The talk was an overview of plasma-based accelerators and their light sources, the challenges for high energy physics, and also new oportunities using structured light pulses (e.g., with orbital angular momentum and with a flying focus), and our recent work on radiation from [quasiparticles](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-023-01311-z).

  headline: Our paper on propagation-invariant optical pulses is out on [Optics Letters](https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.562773).
  fullstory: Propagation-invariant optical pulses have a peak intensity that travels at an arbitrary, tunable velocity while maintaining their spatiotemporal profile. We have shown that their structure is universal, thereby combining a plethora of previously disconnected descriptions. These pulses may be used in processes where phase-locking and an accurate control of the velocity of radiation intensity is key.

  headline: Jorge Vieira gave a Seminar at the EuPRAXIA Virtual Seminar Series.
  fullstory: The [seminar](https://agenda.infn.it/event/45900/page/10216-achieving-superradiant-plasma-accelerator-based-light-sources-with-collective-effects) focused on the recent [quasiparticle light source concept](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-023-01311-z) (which may bring temporal coherence and superradiance to plasma accelerator-based light sources). This was the first seminar of the [EuPRAXIA Virtual Seminar Series](https://agenda.infn.it/event/45900/).
